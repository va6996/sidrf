# Motivation
Resource allocation is very crucial in a cluster where many users compete with each other 
over multiple resources. [Dominant Resource Fairness](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mosharaf/Readings/DRF.pdf) computes the share of each resource
allocated to a user. It defines dominant resource of a user as the resource with maximum share among all the resources allocated to the user.
DRF seeks to maximize the minimum dominant share across all users.For example, if dominant resource of user X is CPU and dominant resource of user Y is  memory, DRF attempts to equalize user X’s share of CPUs with user Y’s share of memory. DRF is essentially max-min fairness if we restrict the number of resources to one.
DRF is sharing incentive in case of homogeneous jobs. But if jobs have varied runtimes then DRF fails the sharing incentive criteria. Consider a case, when a resource hog job arrives first and then resource mice arrives. In this scenario, the later arriving resource mice would have large waiting times. This is because DRF doesn't preempt the jobs. It allocates the resources, by computing the dominant share of all the available jobs at a particular point of time. Once a job gets the resource, there is no notion of preemption.

[Themis](https://cs.nyu.edu/~apanda/classes/sp21/papers/themis.pdf) overcomes the sharing incentive problem of DRF. It uses a preemptive approach and seeks to achieve a finish time fairness. We take inspiration from Themis and DRF. We devise a new fairness metric. Our algorithm is preemptive and is sharing incentive in a more general setting i.e. jobs can be resource hogs or mice.  

# Our Approach: Sharing Incentive Dominant Resource Fairness (SIDRF)

* Similar to DRF, we compute the share of each resource allocated to a user. We take the maximum of all the shares i.e. dominant share. The resource corresponding to the maximum share is called as dominant share.
* The above mentioned dominant share and dominant resource are as per the DRF. We define a new metric Sharing Incentive Dominant Share (SIDS) for each user. SIDS is defined as the linear combination of the user's dominant share as per the DRF algorithm and the time for which the user had the resources.  
```
Sharing Incentive Dominant Share (SIDS) = p * (DRF's Dominant Share) + (1-p) * (t)
where p ∈ (0, 1) and t is the time for which user had the resources
```
* We seek to maximize the minimum Sharing Incentive Dominant Share (SIDS) across all users. We allocate resources to a user with least SIDS. 

* In our algorithm, 'p' acts like a weighing factor between user's dominant share and time for which the user had the resources. If a user is having the resources for long time then it would increase his SIDS and hence his priority would be decreased. This solves the problem when a User X has million of resource mice tasks, while another user Y has a resource hog. Clearly user Y has a high DRF's dominant share compared to user X. Hence user X's mice tasks would be allocated first in case of DRF. It might be possible that the mice tasks of user X occupy huge chunk of the cluster's resources and they have a very long running time. Since DRF doesn't preempt, the tasks of user Y would have to wait. While in case of our algorithm, the SIDS value of user X would increase with time and after a certain point of time, SIDS of X would become larger than the SIDS of user Y. Hence user Y wouldn't have to wait for a long time.  

* We maintain running queue and waiting queue. Running queue contains the jobs which are having the resources while the waiting queue contain the jobs
which aren't having the resources. Our preemption strategy is based on the load factor. We compute the load factor by summing the waiting times of all the jobs in 
the waiting queue and divide it by the summation of the running time of all the jobs in the running queue.
```
Let there are m jobs in waiting queue with waiting time as t_1, t_2, ...,t_m
Let there are n jobs in running queue with running time as t_1, t_2,...., t_n 
t_wait = t_1 + t_2 + ... + t_m
t_run = t_1 + t_2 + ... + t_n
Load Factor = t_wait/ t_run 
```
* If the load factor is greater than the threshold alpha, then we say that it's the time to start preemption. Also, note that how frequently we check the load factor depends on the simulator frequency "Gamma". As the load factor crosses threshold, we kicks on preemption strategy. We go over all the running jobs and if the runtime of the user to which that job belongs is greater than the minimum of average finish time of job divided by waiting queue length and a constant beta then the job is preempted. 
```
\\Preemption strategy
if Load Factor > alpha
  if user's run time of job > min (average finish time of jobs/waiting queue length, beta)
      preempt the job
  else
      don't preempt
```
* After preemption, the jobs are allocated based on the SIDS metric.
* We use preemption mechanism to avoid the cases like, a resource hog job arrives first and DRF allocates resource to the hog. After sometime, a resource mice arrives, since DRF doesn't preempt the resource mice would have to wait till the hog finishes. However, if we have a preemption mechanism then we can preempt the 
hog, thus reducing waiting time for mice.

* Also, we retain the startegy proofness of DRF. Since, we also have DRF's dominant share in the SIDS. If some user lies and demands more resources then his SIDS would be large and would be given lesser priority.

* We preempts only when we have waiting jobs. Also, after preemption, we give all jobs in waiting queue a chance to be back in running queue. This is obviously determined by the SIDS metric. Hence, we also retain the pareto-efficiency property of DRF.

* Moreover our policy is also envy-free similar to DRF.

* Clearly user X is resource mice and user Y is resource hog
* Total resources available <1000, 10000>. We set p = 0.5, alpha = 2, beta = 50 and gamma = 50.

* In the above experiment, we have user X with resource mice and user Y with resource hogs arriving at the same time. Also, the running time of the resource mice is less than that of hog. We observe that the waiting time for both the mice and hog
is decreased in case of our policy (SIDRF). More importantly, the decrease of waiting time for the user X with mice jobs is significantly larger. In this case, we wanted that the user with mice jobs should be favoured more and preemption helps in achieving this. Since the mice jobs have less share and also their 
runtime is less, hence the SIDS value of user X would be less than that of user Y. Due to which, user X is prefered while allocation and also after a certain point of time the longer jobs of user Y are given resources but they are taken off when load factor increases and SIDS value of user Y becomes larger than that of user X. 

## Experiment 2
* We have two users X and Y.
* We assume that tasks are independent
* We sample 1000 tasks for each user X and 500 tasks for user Y demanding two resources <CPU, Memory>

* Resources Memory is sampled using binomial distribution with mean memory usage of user X < mean memory usage of user Y

* In this setup, user X demands lot of time consuming mice tasks i.e. 1000 tasks demanding less cpu and memory resources but for a large amount of time while user Y has fewer resource hog tasks i.e. demanding more of cpu and memeory but having a smaller runtime
* Total resources available <1000, 10000>. We set p = 0.5, alpha = 2, beta = 50 and gamma = 50.

![ux](https://github.com/neeraj71/final-project-report/blob/main/ny736-va2083/images/u2x.png)  ![uy](https://github.com/neeraj71/final-project-report/blob/main/ny736-va2083/images/u2y.png)

* In the above experiment, we have User X with large number of mice jobs with a longer runtime while user Y has fewer resource hogs tasks with shorter runtime. We observe that the waiting time for both the user X and user Y is decreased in case of our policy (SIDRF). In case of DRF, the waiting time per task for User X is more than the waiting time per task for User Y. Because DRF would prefer the user X, as user X's tasks are mice with lesser share. But since they run for a longtime, once allocated the resource would be taken off only when the tasks of User X finishes in case of DRF. Hence tasks of user Y would have to wait for a long time. But in our policy, though tasks of user X would be preferred initially as the runtime is 0 in the begining but as time progresses the SIDS value of user X would grow and when it crosses the SIDS value of user Y. The resource would be taken off from user X. This is evident from a larger decrease in the waiting time for user Y.  

## Effect of Hyperparameter
* We use the data from experiment 2 and observe the effect on waiting time for user X and user Y as we vary the hyperparameters.

* We vary the weighing factor 'p' from 0.1 to 0.9. 

![ux](https://github.com/neeraj71/final-project-report/blob/main/ny736-va2083/images/p.png)

* We vary the Load Factor from 1 to 5.

![ux](https://github.com/neeraj71/final-project-report/blob/main/ny736-va2083/images/a.png)

* We vary beta from 50 to 250.

![ux](https://github.com/neeraj71/final-project-report/blob/main/ny736-va2083/images/b.png)

* When we varied 'p' we observed that the waiting time for user Y first decreased slightly with increase in 'p' and then increased with further increase in 'p'. This is because user X's jobs have longer runtime and if we give more weight to runtime then user X SIDS value would increase and become larger than SIDS value of user Y. Hence user Y, prefers a p value of 0.5. If we increase the 'p' more then the weight factor of runtime i.e. (1-p) would become small. Hence runtime would have lesser importance in SIDS. Therefore, it would take more time when SIDS of X crosses SIDS of Y and Y would have to wait more. 

* Before conducting experiments, we thought that the policy might not be stable w.r.t. the hyperparameters. But the experiments show that the there are minor fluctuations as we vary the hyperparameters 'p', 'alpha' and 'beta'.

# Conclusion
We conclude that the improvise metric which gives importance to the runtime is crucial to asses the dominant nature of a user. 
The novel metric, SIDS is dynamic and is more robust compared to the metric of DRF. It is more genric and can handle the cases of resource hogs and resource mice more efficiently. Moreover, preemption plays an important role in equalizing the SIDS value across users. Though DRF, tries to equalize the dominant share while allocating resources but it loses control once allocation is done. While our policy is more robust since it keeps  track of SIDS and makes a preemption when SIDS value of one user becomes large than the rest. Therefore our policy is sharing incentive in a broader setting. 

# Future Work
We take inspiration from simulated annealing and want to use an energy minimization approach. Basically, we 
would use two exponential functions to define the energy of system. One of the energy function, would increase exponentially as the waiting time of jobs increases and other one would decrease exponentially as the resources are allocated. We subtract the second from first energy function. Since exponential functions are convex and the system's energy is just a linear combination of two convex function. The resultant fucntion is convex. As local minima of strictly convex function is also the global minima. We would like to use a traditional machine learning approach to minimize the energy. However, there are resource 
contraints. Since it is a constrained setting, we would like to use Projected Gradient Descent.
